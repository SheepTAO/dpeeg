# dpeeg

Dpeeg provides a complete workflow for deep learning decoding EEG tasks, including basic datasets (datasets 
can be easily customized), basic network models, model training, rich experiments, and detailed experimental 
result storage.

Each module in dpeeg is decoupled as much as possible to facilitate the use of separate modules.
