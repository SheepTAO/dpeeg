## ðŸŽ¯ Original Intention

This is a workflow developed by one person for deep learning to decode EEG signals (only supports [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)). The original intention is to facilitate scientific researchers to quickly start focusing on research rather than code implementation. I personally think that many of the implementations are very low-level because they are all written based on my personal hobbies. However, I also learned a lot after looking at other people's libraries. The process is still interesting.
