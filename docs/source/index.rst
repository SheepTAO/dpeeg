   Open-source Python package for analyzing, exploring, training, and building 
   deep learning models based on EEG data.


Thank you for visiting the dpeeg documentation and associated 
https://github.com/SheepTAO/dpeeg

This is a toolkit for deep learning decoding of EEG signals that provides a 
complete workflow from data reading to experimental analysis (currently only 
supports PyTorch). The original intention is to facilitate scientific 
researchers to quickly start focusing on research rather than code 
implementation. If you find any bugs or have suggestions for improvements, 
please feel free to open an 
`issues <https://github.com/SheepTAO/dpeeg/issues>`_.
